1. What is Emmet?
   Ans : Emmet is a tool that allows developers to write and expand shorthand syntax for HTML, XML, and other languages. It is designed to speed up the process of writing and editing code by providing a set of shortcuts and abbreviations that can be quickly expanded into full code blocks.

   In Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Emmet is built-in and can be accessed by typing abbreviations and then pressing the Tab key to expand them.
   For example, typing "div.container" and pressing Tab will expand to:

    <div class="container"></div>

   Emmet also supports a wide range of other shorthand syntax, including tags, attributes, and nested elements. It can be a useful tool for quickly writing and editing code, and is widely used by developers working with HTML and other web development technologies.

2. Difference between a Library and Framework?
   Ans : A library is a collection of pre-written code that can be used to perform common tasks or functions. Libraries are typically called or imported into a project and used as needed. They are useful for providing a set of useful tools or functions that can be easily incorporated into a project without having to write the code from scratch.

    A framework, on the other hand, is a set of conventions and tools for building and organizing code. A framework provides a structure and set of guidelines for developing a specific type of application or solving a specific problem. It often includes a set of libraries and tools, but also imposes a certain structure or way of doing things on the developer.

    One key difference between libraries and frameworks is that libraries are called by the code, while frameworks call the code. In other words, when you use a library, you are in control of how and when it is used. With a framework, the framework is in control and dictates how the code should be organized and used.

    For example, if you were building a web application, you might use a library like jQuery to provide a set of tools for manipulating the DOM, but you would use a framework like Ruby on Rails to structure the overall application and provide tools for routing, database management, and other common tasks.
